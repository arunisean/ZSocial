# NIP-3041 - Poll & Vote Event with logic clock

> Poll and vote events are a way to create a poll and vote for it.\
> Polls are directly integrated into message events (1), and responses are vote events (9) to avoid overloading the loading of messages in clients in NIP-41.
> In order to present the integration of logic clock more clearly, use the kind 301(1) and 309(9) as substitutes.
> A modified version of Event Counts (NIP-45) is used to implement the query of logic clock for a specific SID in the network or relay.

## Specs

### Kind `301` - Message & Poll

To create a poll, include a `poll` tag in the message event. with the following format:

```text
tag: poll
options:
 - <multi|single> allow others to reply with one or multiple options
 - <ttl> TTL (in seconds|timestamp) when surv expires, 0 TTL don't expire
 - <title> optional poll name ("" if not present)
 - [<option>]: array of string
```

#### Example - Message

```json
{
  ...
  "kind": 301,
  "tags": [
    ...
    ["poll", "single", "0", "I'm a title!", "Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
    ...
  ],
}
```
The event ID of kind 301 is used to represent the SID of a specific state, which in this case is the Poll & Vote event ID. 

### Kind `309` - Vote

To vote for a poll, you have to send an event kind `309`.\
The format of the event is the following:

```text
kind: 309
content: <reason for voting> // Can be empty string
tag: poll_r // for poll response
options:
  - [<choices>]: array of index of the option | the first option is 0
```

#### Example - Vote

```json
{
  ...
  "kind": 309,
  "tags": [
    ...
    ["e", "<event-id>"],
    ["poll_r", "0"],
    // OR
    ["poll_r", "0", "2"]
    ...
  ],
  "content": "reason for voting"
}
```

## Relay and client recommendations

- Options should be limited to 4 options and should not display more than **4 options** in the poll
- Each option should be 25 chars limited
- Clients should display poll options if more than **one option** is present in the poll
- Clients should ignore vote events if the poll is **expired**
- Clients should not display more than one poll per message. The first poll in the message should be displayed.
- Poll title should be displayed if present and should be limited to 25 chars

## Warning

Keep in mind that all votes are public and accessible to everyone.
